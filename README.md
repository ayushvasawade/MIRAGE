## ❗ Current Problem

Modern medical education and surgical planning are heavily dependent on:

- Physical cadavers  
- Expensive simulation platforms like **AnatomyX** (by CAE Simulations)

However, AnatomyX is:
- 💸 Extremely costly: ₹6–7 Crores per unit  
- 🎧 Requires Microsoft HoloLens (₹6–7 Lakhs) for VR access  
- 📍 Scarce in availability — only 1 unit exists in Maharashtra  

This creates a major barrier for most medical institutions, particularly in developing regions.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The current reliance on high-cost virtual systems and physical cadavers makes modern medical training and surgical simulation inaccessible for the majority of educational and healthcare institutions. Hardware dependencies, such as the Microsoft HoloLens, further limit the scalability of these systems. This results in restricted exposure to advanced surgical practices and inhibits hands-on skill development for students and professionals.

## ✅ Proposed Solution — MediSphereAR

**MediSphereAR** is a hardware-flexible, cost-effective **Augmented Reality platform** designed to:

- Eliminate dependency on VR headsets and cadavers  
- Run seamlessly on smartphones, tablets, and AR glasses  
- Provide immersive and interactive surgical education and planning  

### 🩺 Core Functionalities

- 🧠 **Virtual Cadaver-less Dissection** using realistic 3D anatomical models  
- 🩻 **Preoperative Surgical Simulations** anchored over real patient bodies  
- 🦾 **Postoperative Complication Analysis** through detailed visualization  
- 🧭 **Real-time Surgical Tracing & AR Guidance**  
- 📤 **Export Patient-Specific Models** for remote collaboration and rehearsal  
- 📚 **Reusable Models** for academic teaching and future references  

---

## 🎯 Feature Spotlight — Patient-Specific Simulation Export

MediSphereAR allows the creation and export of **3D anatomical models** derived from:

- CT scans  
- MRI data  
- X-ray imaging  

These exported simulations can be used to:

- Plan and rehearse surgeries virtually  
- Share with external doctors for collaborative procedures  
- Guide intraoperative steps through AR anchoring  
- Save for postoperative comparison and research
